Ikaika Lee and Adam Dupuy

Made modifications to a couple functions in Semant.Semant notably fixing the 1st pass in transDec.
Added a new level for translation before the transExp call in transProg.
Finished FindEscape.FindEscape to catch the variables that escape.
Added code for allocating formal parameters in Mips.MipsFrame.

There seems to be issues with INT based on our runs but we are unsure of what could be causing it
but everything else seems to be working as intended.  For this project we used the book and followed the
assignment pdf as closely as possible.
